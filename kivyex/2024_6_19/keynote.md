 - [x] PREREQ: INSTALL VIDEO
 - [x] **why use this widget?**
	 - [x] If you have a need to display graphs, matplotlib + kivy is one solution.
 - [x] plotly from what I have seen does not have a UI or buttons to press, it just graphs well
 - [x] https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/
 - [x] https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/#heatmaps
- [x] INSTALLATION
	- [x] go over installation (just pip install kivy-matplotlib-widget or poetry add kivy-matplotlib-widget)
	- [x] to check out the examples:
	- [x] git clone the repo https://github.com/mp-007/kivy_matplotlib_widget
- [x] cd to examples and check it out!

- [ ] KEY FEATURES:
	- [x] reset axis on double-click (home button)
	- [x] **zoom** with 2 fingers or **mouse scroll**
	- [x] **pan** with 1 finger or mouse left click

	- [x] fast rendering mode (axis not updated for faster draw)
	- [x] use only 1 package (matplotlib) and no additional backend
